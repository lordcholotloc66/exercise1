///*1.Create a variable with a name of your choosing that has a value of 15
//2.Create a 2nd variable with a name of your choosing that has a value of 5
//3.Create a 3rd variable that stores that sum of the 1st and 2nd variables (20 should print to the screen)
//4.Create a 4th variable that stores the result of a multiplication operation - the stored result should be equal to 45
//5.Create a 5th variable that stores the result of the 1st variable minus the 2nd variable - the result should be 10
//6.Create a 6th variable that stores the result of the 1st variable divided by the 2nd variable - the result should be 3
//7.Create 3 new variables of any name and of any value, but all on the same line
//8.Create 3 constants (let) of any name and of any value, but all on the same line
//9.Create an explicit variable of any name of type Double and don't give it any value
//10.Create another explicit variable of any name of type Int but DO give it an initial value of 423
//11.Create a variable of type String with a value of "Hello"
//12.Create another variable of type String with a value of "World"
//13.Create a 3rd variable to store the result of concatenating the first two strings (using the + symbol)
//14.Using that 3rd variable again, store the result of concatenating the first two string but instead using "(someVar)" syntax (string interpolation)
